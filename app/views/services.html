          Orthotic devices are very affective in managing a variety biomechanical foot
          pathologies. Orthotics come in many shapes and styles with prices ranging greatly.
          Your doctor at Gainesville Podiatry Associates will be happy to discuss orthotic
          options with you looking to fine the most appropriate device for both your treatment
          and your pocketbook. Occasionally a custom orthotic is necessary but in many other
          cases a device such as the 1st Step orthotic from Wrymark can be modified just for
          you. We also offer a midrange leather device which may be more durable.
